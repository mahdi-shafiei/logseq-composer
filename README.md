# Logseq Composer ✍️

**Logseq Composer** is a plugin that connects your notes with any LLM using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Hope you find it useful! 😀👍🍀🍷

### ⚙️ How it works

- Uses [OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) for vector search
- Retrieves relevant notes using RAG
- Pipes the results into any LLM via [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)
- You can use **any LLM** (OpenRouter, local, Claude, etc.)
- Currently, an **OpenAI API key is required for embeddings** – LLM itself can be anything
